# cutePy-compiler
# Description

A python compiler for cutePy, a python-like programming language. This project compiles cutePy code to risc-V assembly with multiple intermediate steps to ensure it can be altered in the future to support more assemblers as well.

# Getting Started

1. Run the ``main.py`` using python 3.10 and above is recommended:
``python3 main.py path_to_test_program\test_program_name.cpy``
2. The result can be found inside final_code_output. Additionally the intermidiate code is saved in a file on the same path as the .cpy file
